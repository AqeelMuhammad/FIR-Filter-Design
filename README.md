# FIR-Filter-Design

* This is an individual project for EN2570 - Digital Signal Processing module in department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
* Final goal of this project is to design a Finite Duration Impulse Response(FIR) bandpass Digital Filter under some given specifications
* Here we are using the Fourier Series method with Kaiser window which is a direct method of filter designing.
* The filter is implemented using MATLAB R2018a and plots are used for analyzing purposes.
